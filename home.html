                “We are conducting an unprecedented experiment with our planet”,
                “The temperature has only moved a few tenths of a degree for us until now, just small
                wiggles in the road. But now we are hitting a curve we've never seen before.”
                
                “We are on a catastrophic path, we can either save our world or condemn humanity to
                a hellish future.”</p>

                <p>...............................................................................................................................................................................</p>
                <p>Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for many
                    decades! Substantial drought, extreme rainfall, rise in ocean temperatures seem to be
                    on the rise! As God’s people we ought to be accountable to Him as stewards of His
                    stupendous creation!
                </p>

                <p>In Genesis 2:15, God has clearly placed humans in a position of responsibility over the
                    creation! We recognize that all created things belong to God.
                    “The earth is the Lord’s, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it; for He
                    founded it upon the seas and established it upon the waters.” Psalm 24:1-2
                    Thus remain accountable to God as stewards of creation!
                </p>

                <p>God commissions us to rule over the creation in a way that sustains, protects,
                    and enhances his works so that all creation may fulfill the purposes God
                    intended for it. We must manage the environment not simply for our own
                    benefit but for God′s glory.
                </p>

                <p>“For of Him, and through Him, and to Him are all things, to whom be glory forever.
                    Amen” Romans 11:36[Remember Wednesday’s Fello Sermon, Soli Deo Gloria? ]</p> 

                <p><em>Well, isn’t protecting the environment unimportant in comparison to sharing the gospel
                    and other God-given tasks?</em></p>

                <p>God is definitely concerned with the physical world as well as the spiritual world, and
                    restoration of the creation is part of the good news of Christ. Recall Christ feeding the
                    5000 in Mathew 14, in verse 20, we see the disciples picking up 12 basketfuls of
                    broken pieces that were left over. This shows just how much concerned God is with
                    the environment! <br>
                 <p>We are not to neglect the task of sharing the good news of Christ’s redeeming work in
                        our lives, but neither should we neglect the work of “tending the garden”
                        Caring for God’s creation is part of our service to God and an integral part of our role
                        as servant leader’s in God’s kingdom.
                  </p>
